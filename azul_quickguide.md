2. Tally point addition
    1. No adjacent tile(s) to the newly placed tile on the _wall*_
        1. 1 point added to total points.
    2. x adjacent tile(s) to the newly placed tile on the _wall*_
        1. x point(s) for x tiles connected adjacently with the placed tile.
            1. E.g. Placed tile now connects 3 tiles horizontally, that is worth 3 points
            2. E.g. Placed tile now connects 4 tiles vertically, that is worth 4 points
            3. E.g. Placed tile now connects 3 tiles horizontally and 4 tiles vertically, that is worth 7 points

    - Fill as many factories with 4 tiles, then proceed.
- Multicolored _pattern line*_
    - A single _pattern line*_ must only have one type of tile. 
        - E.g., Adding only yellow to a _pattern line*_ is allowed.
        - E.g., Adding brown and black to a _pattern line*_ is **not** allowed.

    - Allowed. 
        - E.g., All 5 pattern lines is made of blue tiles.
- Unable to transfer to _wall*_

- Total points less than 0
    - Players' cannot have a score lesser than zero.
